# Threepress Starter Theme

## Based in the bones starter theme (http://themble.com/bones/)

A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)
